## Pre-requirements:

* Expo

Open up a terminal and navigate to the repo. Make sure you have expo installed and write `expo start`. This will start up a localhost which can run the application. 
Using the Expo app on iOS or Android enables you to scan the qr-code and displays the app directly in your phone. it is also possible to connect an emulator (see instructions from error messages) or display the application directly in the web. 

## Installing expo via npm:

`npm install expo-cli --global`

If you have not installed npm, it can be installed from [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
