## Pre-requirements:

* Expo
* React Native

Open up a terminal and navigate to the repo. Make sure you have expo installed and write "expo start". This will start up a localhost which can run the application. 
Using the Expo app on iOS or Android enables you to scan the qr-code and displays the app directly in your phone. it is also possible to connect an emulator (see instructions from error messages) or directly in the web.
